### Goal.
This project aims to develop a machine learning plugin for Rhino\Grasshopper by making use of the well-known Python module (Scikit-learn) using Rhnio-Common C# and python programming language to bring sophisticated Machine-Learning supervised and unsupervised learning methods to be handy to regular designers and architects. It is open source and is released under BSD "simplified" licence.
