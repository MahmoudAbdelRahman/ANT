### Goal.
This project aims to develop a machine learning plugin for Rhino\Grasshopper by making use of the well-known Python module (Scikit-learn) using Rhnio-Common C# and python programming language to bring sophisticated Machine-Learning supervised and unsupervised learning methods to be handy to regular designers and architects. It is open source and is released under BSD "simplified" licence.

### Instructions for installing
This plugin is based on Python and scikit-learn, while scikit-learn depends on Numpy and scipy modules. Thus, it is important to ensure having these tools installed in your system and working properly.
To install scikit-learn on your machine, you could follow instructions on this link: [installing scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).

#### It is highly recommended to install scikit-learn via a python bundle, these come with all required libraries, such as: [Python(x,y)](http://python-xy.github.io/), [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)
On the other hand, this plugin (in the present time) has been tested in Windows environment with python 2.7. If you are using earlier of latter versions, we highly recommend that you kindly submit any bug appears.
